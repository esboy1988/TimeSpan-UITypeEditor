# TimeSpan-UITypeEditor
Type converter and UI editor for .Net TimeSpan in a property grid

A little project to develop and test type conversion and UI editing of .Net TimeSpan data in a property grid.

The built-in support is ok for hh:mm:ss but not for much else. I'm typically working with seconds and milliseconds and needed something a little more intuitive.

This solution demonstrates:

* String conversion to/from TimeSpan
* Dropdown panel with up/down numeric editors for TimeSpan components
* A trick to set a DefaultValue of a TimeSpan on a property

(Will add screenshots if I figure out how to do it!)
